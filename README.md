# Example Event Graph Simulations for OA3302

## Directions
Add the code to a Python IDE of your choosing (my preference is the community edition of PyCharm)

The <tt>oa3302</tt> package contains the components in several files.

The <tt>oa3302.run</tt> package contains "main" programs to execute most of the examples in <tt>oa3302</tt>.
You can use them as templates for running your own models.
